#Dimenisfy - A Two Dimensional Blockchain
A two-dimensional Blockchain system - first of its kind that incorporates blockchain in multiple dimension to improve transaction throughput and computation time. <br />
It also helps executing coumputationally intensive Smart Contracts and arriving at consensus faster.<br />
The basic idea is in blockchain more the inter-arrival time of blocks higher is the security of the system. But this also means lower transaction throughput.
Dimensify aims to solve this by creating a new blockchain with current block as its genesis.<br />
So at each level of block there is another blockchain in 2nd-dimension.
we continue to add blocks with faster mining method like Proof-of stake in the 2d- blockchain while we wait for the next block to arrive.<br />
Once a new POW block arrives the 2d-blockchain of previous block stops and a new 2d-blockchain of the latest block starts.<br />
